# Choribambino

Small library to download weather station data from the Peruvian weather
service (SENAMHI). This data is free of access in their
[website](https://www.senamhi.gob.pe/?&p=descarga-datos-hidrometeorologicos),
so there is nothing _illegal_.

## Installation

Just clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/profesorpaiche/choribambino
```

## How to use

First, create the directory `data`. All the files will be automatically saved there.

```
mkdir data
```

And then just run the `choribambino.py` script.

```
python3 choribambino.py
```

Have fun with the data!
