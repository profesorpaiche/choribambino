# Choribambino

Small library to download weather station data from the Peruvian weather
service (SENAMHI). This data is free of access in their
[website](https://www.senamhi.gob.pe/?&p=descarga-datos-hidrometeorologicos),
so there is nothing _illegal_.

## How to use

Just run the `choribambino.py` script.

```
python3 choribambino.py
```
